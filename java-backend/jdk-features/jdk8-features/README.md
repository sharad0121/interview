What is Lambda Expression

This is the functional programming style fairly old but new concept in java since jdk8
the idea is in object-oriented programming we can not imagine methods outside the scope 
object or without a class.

the methods can take objects as arguments which can have any state depending upon 
the data but we can not pass the operation to be performed in object-oriented programming

We have to write the operations in methods itself which is receiving the objects

The Lambda expressions overcome this problem by allowing to pass the operation or behaviour in general 
to be passed as an argument of a method or at the place where it has to be used.
