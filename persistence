persistence deals with storing the data into database from java application and retrieving the data back from the database into an 
application, however there are many ways this is done few of them relevant to java are as follows

jdbc -> absolute as there are more drawbacks than advantages
hibernate/jpa -> now relevant in the java world
spring data jpa -> similar to hibernate/jpa providers further abstraction on top of jpa like repositories automatic query generation
for method names, integration with other spring modules such as spirng mvc, spring boot, spring security etc.

even though the spring data jpa is a best choice in the spring environment in order to understand all the concepts from the scratch
hibernate knowledge is essential. spring data jpa is another wrapper around jpa just like jpa is wrapper around jdbc.
